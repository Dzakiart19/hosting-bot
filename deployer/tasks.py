    The main task to deploy a user's project.

    This task will perform the following steps:
    1. Download the .zip file from MinIO.
    2. Scan the file for viruses with ClamAV.
    3. Extract the .zip file.
    4. Detect the project's runtime (Python, Node, etc.).
    5. Generate a dynamic Dockerfile if a custom one is not provided.
    6. Build the Docker image.
    7. Push the image to a registry (e.g., GHCR, Docker Hub, or a local registry).
    8. Deploy the image as a new container with the correct network and subdomain settings.
    9. Update the project status in the database via the API.
    10. Send a notification to the user via the Telegram bot.
